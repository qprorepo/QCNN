Quantum Convolution with Groupwise Kernels, Stride, and Feature Pooling for Feature Extraction


Quantum computing has brought innovative anticipation to image processing regarding efficiently handling large amounts of data and complex computations. This paper discusses the potential of quantum convolution as a feature extractor in quantum images. The paper reviews several quantum convolution (QuC) techniques, including complex coefficients, multiple kernels, stride, padding, and pooling. This paper also presents batch normalization (BN), such advanced methods as separable, weighted, dilated, grouped, and depthwise separable kernels. Comparisons with classical convolutional neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) realize a higher accuracy of 96.67% and a faster inference time of 5 milliseconds. Model performance is measured in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, along with the training time and inference time. Other parameters studied in this paper for QuC's computational efficiency are circuit depth, memory overhead, qubit utilization, gate count, and energy consumption.
